						<p>
						Whoa, how'd you get here?! I'm Darryl,  an incoming third year Computer Science major (and Statistics minor) at the University of California, Irvine. As an aspiring developer, I’m constantly learning new programming techniques and technologies through school and through new opportunities. I hope to use these experiences to pursue  a career related to Software Development, Data Science, or Business Intelligence. Thanks for visiting my website! There's still a lot of work to be done. This website is being built using simple HTML/CSS, Twitter's Bootstrap, and jQuery.

			<h4 align="center"> What Do I Do? </h4>
			<p>
		I’m a programmer. After taking an introductory computer programming course back in my senior year of high school, I found coding to a be a powerful and fascinating skill.   The satisfaction of building functional and working programs easily was worth the time it took to learn new programming techniques and to work the minor bugs that came up along the way.  Coding has taught me to think things through thoroughly and carefully, but also to  appreciate the ups and downs of the development process.  If anything, I’ve learned that the things worth pursuing are things that aren’t easily accomplished on the first try.
  
			</p>

			<p>At school, I’ve  programmed extensively with Python and C++, and introduced to other tools like MySQL and Git. Currently, I’m trying my hand at web development (hence this website), and right now I’m trying to learn some web frameworks, starting with React.js.   My experience continues to expand, through my college education and through self-learning. You can check some of things I work on in my Portfolio (under construction), or visit my <a href="https://github.com/dkmak"> Github </a>.

			<h4 align="center"> Where Have I Been? </h4>
			<p>
			Since high school, I've had the wonderful opportunity to work for and be a leader at a variety of different organizations and companies, such as:

			<p>A little bit about me:</p>

			<ul>
			<li>
			<p>
			I’ve found that I’m not particularly good at describing myself, but I’ve found out that online personality tests, like the Myer-Briggs, to be surprisingly accurate. The few times I’ve taken the Myers-Briggs personality test, I have been assessed to be an  INFJ personality (“The Advocate”, which you can read about <a href="(https://www.16personalities.com/infj-personality">here</a>)

			</p>
			</li>

			<li>
			<p>
			I’m a proud Bay Area native, and with that comes a love for Bay Area sports. I fell in love with the Golden State Warriors and the San Francisco 49ers at an early age, and they are an integral part of who I am.  
			</p>
			</li>

			<li>
			<p>
			 My hobbies include playing golf, working out, watching sports with friends, listening to a variety of different types of music. I was introduced to golf back in middle school by my brother, and as we've gotten older attempted to keep golf in our lives. I have a causal interest in photo editing and photography that I hope to expand on in the near future.
